"""The two training objectives, both evaluated in measurement coordinates.

This is the heart of the rung-4 contrast (PLAN_04 §2, PLAN_03 §2A.4).

``normalise_input_sequence`` (tidmad/backbone/model.py) z-scores each row
of the ``(B*C, M)`` input independently, so for noise-dominated bands it is
*approximately whitening*. If the loss were computed on the standardised
representation, plain MSE would already be the ``Σ⁻¹``-weighted residual and the
two arms would optimise the same objective. Therefore:

1. The model consumes the standardised representation (both arms, identically).
2. The reconstruction head's output is mapped back to measurement
   (unstandardised) STFT coordinates using the per-band scale factors recorded
   during normalisation.
3. Both losses are evaluated on that measurement-coordinate residual:
   ``loss_mse = resid.pow(2).mean()`` and
   ``loss_chi2 = (resid.pow(2) / J).mean()`` with ``J`` the per-band noise PSD.

``J`` is the median-averaged per-band power of noise-only calibration windows
measured through the data pipeline's own (Hann) STFT, so the whitened residual
is weighted in the loss's coordinate system. It is floored at source
(``psd.estimate_band_psd``) so no band divides by a near-zero power. The
archived Welch density (boxcar, median — Paper 1 Phase-4 methodology) is
recorded alongside for provenance but does not enter the loss; see the note in
``config.TidmadDataConfig``. A global periodogram normalization constant is
immaterial to the contrast and is absorbed into the loss/lr scale.
