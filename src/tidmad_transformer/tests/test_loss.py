"""BLOCKING gate (PLAN_04 §2, §3.6 item 1): the two objectives must be genuinely
different.

If the loss were computed on the standardised representation (or the input were
whitened), plain MSE would already be the chi2-weighted residual and the two
arms would optimise the same objective. This test constructs residuals whose
energy is concentrated in low- versus high-noise bands and asserts that the
chi2 objective ranks them opposite to raw MSE — something proportional losses
cannot do.
