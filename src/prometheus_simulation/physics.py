"""The recorded physics configuration.

Every value carries a provenance tag, because the difference between "NuBench
said so" and "we chose it" is the difference between a reproduction and an
inspired-by. The tags are:

    nubench   stated in arXiv:2511.13111
    ours      our choice; NuBench does not constrain it
    ask       NOT published -- we chose a value, and the choice is a deviation
              that must be declared (and is what to ask the authors for)

`PhysicsParameters.record()` writes the full set, tags included, next to the
simulation output. Nothing about a produced event set should ever have to be
reconstructed from memory.
