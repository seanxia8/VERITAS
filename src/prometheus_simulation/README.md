# `prometheus_simulation` — one event set, every geometry

Generates the cross-geometry event set that NuBench's released data cannot
provide: **600 events at exactly 10 TeV, placed at three fixed vertices, and
reconstructed by six different detector geometries.**

| held fixed | varied |
|---|---|
| energy — 10 TeV exactly | detector geometry (6 arms) |
| vertex — 3 named points | direction (isotropic; same per event across arms) |
| the injected events themselves | medium (1 control arm) |
| | photon seed (1 null arm) |

NuBench's seven datasets are independently injected, so comparing geometry A to
geometry B compares two *populations* and any difference in reconstruction
error mixes the geometry effect with the sample difference. Prometheus supports
replaying a stored injection (`injection.lepton_injector.inject = False` plus
`paths.injection_file`), which makes the comparison within-event.

## What is in here

Two layers, one package. `oracle_paired` was merged in on 2026-09-04; keeping
them apart split one experiment across two packages.

| layer | modules |
|---|---|
| **geometry & injection** | `geometry.py` (.geo parsing, offsets, common region, containment), `simulate.py` (inject once, recentre, replay every arm), `physics.py` (the provenance-tagged parameter record), `plans.py` (Prometheus run-plan JSON for cluster dispatch, no Prometheus import) |
| **detector response & cells** | `detector.py` (`DetectorGeometry`, the OM table), `events.py`, `response.py` (NuBench §3.2 emulation), `interventions.py` (N1–N5), `strata.py` (S and U families), `matching.py` (content-matched clean twins), `export.py` (Parquet with `injection_id`), `toy.py` |
| **readout & analysis** | `readout.py`, `recon.py` (geometry-free baselines), `analyze.py` (headless report) |

`geometry.Geometry` parses the `.geo` files and owns offsets and containment;
`detector.DetectorGeometry` is the OM-position table the response stage works
on. Different jobs, deliberately different types.

## The defect the merge fixed

`plans.prometheus_config_pairs` (formerly `oracle_paired/config.py`) used to
say *"Only `detector.geo_file` differs otherwise — that is the entire
experimental manipulation."* It is not, and nothing in that package handled a
detector offset.

Prometheus applies the offset to the injection file **in place** and **only**
on the `inject=True` path (`lepton_injector_utils.apply_detector_offset`),
while `injection_from_LI_output` takes `**_` and **ignores** `detector_offset`
on load. A stored injection therefore lives in the first detector's absolute
frame. ORCA is centred at z = +95 m and ARCA at z = −3194 m, so replaying the
ORCA injection into ARCA with only `geo_file` changed places every event about
3.3 km away and **every replayed arm yields zero hits**.

`prometheus_config_pairs` now emits a per-arm injection path plus the
`recentre_delta_m` that produces it, and `simulate.build_event_set` applies it.
`tests/test_configs.py::test_replay_recentre_delta_is_non_zero_for_offset_geometries`
is the regression guard: it asserts the ORCA→ARCA translation really is a
kilometre-scale shift.

## Quick start

```bash
# Geometry work needs no clone: the .geo files fall back to
# data/geofiles/. Only running Prometheus needs this.
bash src/prometheus_simulation/fetch_prometheus.sh
cd src/prometheus_simulation/external/prometheus
bash install.sh --with-ppc          # NOT pip install -r requirements.txt:
                                    # PROPOSAL and LeptonInjector are C++ builds,
                                    # and the ice arm needs PPC
source scripts/activate.sh .prometheus_env && cd -

PYTHONPATH=src python -m prometheus_simulation.geometry                      # geometry survey
PYTHONPATH=src python -m prometheus_simulation.simulate --out runs/pilot     # plan only, no CPU
PYTHONPATH=src python -m prometheus_simulation.simulate --out runs/pilot --execute
```

Then open `notebooks/geometry_survey.ipynb`.

To hand the production run to an agent on a cluster, give it `AGENT_PROMPT.md`
verbatim.

## The geometries

Parsed from the geofiles Prometheus ships. String counts match NuBench Table 1
exactly, which is the check that these are the right files.

| dataset | geofile | modules | strings | offset z (m) | r_horiz (m) | half-height (m) | header medium |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| flower_s (ORCA) | `orca.geo` | 3300 | 150 | +95.4 | 100.2 | 95.4 | mediterranean |
| flower_l (ARCA) | `arca.geo` | 2070 | 115 | −3194.0 | 500.9 | 306.0 | mediterranean |
| flower_xl (TRIDENT) | `trident.geo` | 24220 | 1211 | −3090.0 | 1949.6 | 285.0 | water |
| triangle (P-ONE) | `pone_triangle.geo` | 60 | 3 | −0.0 | 57.7 | 500.0 | water |
| cluster (Baikal-GVD) | `gvd.geo` | 288 | 8 | −970.0 | 60.0 | 270.0 | water |
| hexagon (IceCube) | `icecube.geo` | 5160 | 86 | −1972.0 | 596.3 | 518.7 | ice |

NuBench simulated **all six in water** and added **one ice dataset** on the
Hexagon geometry, so the shipped headers are overridden per arm — the header is
what selects PPC (ice) vs olympus (water).

## The four things that make this non-trivial

1. **The geometries do not share a coordinate frame.** Detector centres run
   from z = +95 m to z = −3194 m. Prometheus applies the detector offset to the
   injection file *in place*, and only when generating it
   (`apply_detector_offset`); `injection_from_LI_output` takes `**_` and
   **ignores** `detector_offset` on load. Replaying verbatim puts every event
   kilometres away. → `geometry.recentre_delta`.

2. **No injection cylinder can serve all six.** They span 34× in radius, so at
   every radius either the small geometries see almost none of the injected
   events or the large ones are probed in a fraction of a percent of their
   volume — the two never rise together, and the best crossing point is ~2.5%
   on both (`geometry.sweep_cylinders`). The design therefore uses **three
   fixed injection points** instead of a sampled volume, which turns a
   trade-off into a containment check. The points are detector-relative and
   must lie in the **common region** — radius ≤ 57.7 m (set by `triangle`),
   |z| ≤ 95.4 m (set by `flower_s`); `simulate.plan()` refuses to run
   otherwise.

   | point | (x, y, z) m | probes |
   |---|---|---|
   | `centre` | (0, 0, 0) | on axis, mid-depth |
   | `radial` | (40, 0, 0) | 69% of the common radius |
   | `vertical` | (0, 0, 70) | 73% of the common half-height |

3. **There is no zero-point.** Photon propagation is re-run per arm and is
   seedable only to Poisson level. The `photon_null` arm — reference geometry,
   same events, different photon seed — measures that floor. Every
   cross-geometry number is reported as a multiple of its p95, never raw.

4. **Depth changes with the geometry.** The Earth model is built at
   `-detector_offset[2]`, so recentring changes the overburden and
   LeptonInjector weights do not transfer across arms. Report **unweighted,
   per-event, truth-referenced** metrics only.

## A structural limit of the medium control

Prometheus selects the photon propagator from the **medium**: olympus (JAX) for
water, PPC for ice. So `hexagon` vs `hexagon_ice_le` — the "medium-only"
control — also changes the propagation *implementation*, and cannot separate
medium from propagator on its own.

This is structural, not a configuration choice: PPC is ice-specific (south-pole
ice tables), so water cannot be routed through it. State it as a limitation
rather than working around it. Within PPC, the CPU and CUDA binaries are two
builds of the same algorithm, so `use_gpu` changes the build but not the
family — verify they agree on a small sample before relying on it.

**The six water arms are unaffected.** They all run olympus, so the geometry
comparison — the actual experiment — is like-for-like. Only the control carries
this caveat. Each arm writes `arm_record.json` naming the propagator it
actually used, and `analyze.py` prints the table and the caveat in REPORT.md.

## Upstream quirks we work around

`external/prometheus` is LGPL-2.1 and pinned, so nothing there is patched.
Two behaviours are compensated for in `simulate.run_arm` instead:

- **`ppc.paths.force` does not make a re-run safe.** `prometheus.py` guards the
  PPC tmpdir with `if tmpdir.exists() and not force: raise
  PpcTmpdirExistsError`, then calls `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=False)`
  unconditionally — so `force` only converts a typed error into a raw
  `FileExistsError`. A `--arm <name>` retry after a crash or OOM would fail on
  the leftover directory instead of resuming. We remove it first.
- **`config.run.outfile` is a process-wide singleton.** Prometheus derives it
  from `storage_prefix` only while it is `None`, so whoever sets it first fixes
  it for the process and every later arm writes to that same path — while
  reporting success, because from Prometheus' side nothing failed. `inject_once`
  and `run_arm` both reset it, and `run_arm` then verifies a non-empty parquet
  landed in the arm's own directory before returning. The parallel path never
  showed this (fresh process per arm), so it was invisible where runs are
  launched and fatal where they are debugged.
- **The default tmpdir is `./.ppc_tmp`, relative to the working directory,** so
  concurrent ice arms would share one scratch directory. Each arm now gets its
  own under its output directory.

`tests/test_ppc_tmpdir.py` pins both, including a retry over a leftover
directory as the regression guard.

## Hardware

Two independent GPU paths, neither on by default. Seven of the eight arms are
**water** → olympus (JAX), which uses the GPU only if a CUDA `jaxlib` is
installed — `requirements.txt` pins the CPU build, so a GPU box runs on the CPU
silently. One arm (`hexagon_ice_le`) is **ice** → PPC, whose CUDA binary
`install.sh --with-ppc` does *not* build (`make cpu` only); use
`container/Dockerfile.gpu` or `make gpu arch=<SM>`, and match `SM_ARCH` to the
card. `use_gpu: true` switches only the ice arm.

CPU is a legitimate way to run this: ~1.5–13 CPU-hours for the full set,
parallel over arms.

`olympus_max_distance_m` (300 m) is **physics, not memory** — it drops
source-module pairs before propagation, so a central event in `flower_xl`
(r = 1950 m) illuminates only the inner ~300 m. Lower `olympus_photon_chunk`
for memory instead.

## Recorded physics

Every parameter carries a provenance tag — `nubench` (stated in
arXiv:2511.13111), `ours`, or `ask` (never published). `physics_record.json` is
written beside every run with the full set, the tags, a config fingerprint, and
the repo and Prometheus commits. Each run prints its `ask` list at the end;
that list is the paper's declared-deviations section.

Currently `ask`: spectral index (inert at fixed energy), zenith/azimuth range,
endcap length, Earth model. Also unpublished and not modelled here at all: the NuBench detector
response of their §3.2 (per-OM noise rate, per-dataset TTS, ice angular
acceptance) — this package produces *photon hits*, not NuBench-format pulses.

## Licence position

Prometheus is LGPL-2.1: used as a library, never patched, pinned by commit.
The geometries ship with Prometheus, not with NuBench. GraphNeT (DynEdge) is
Apache-2.0. The NuBench repository states **no licence**, so its datasets,
predictions and checkpoints are not used by this package at all — which is
what makes this path free of any permission question.
